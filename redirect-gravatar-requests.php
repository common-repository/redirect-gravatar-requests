	 * If a Gravatar (or no avatar) was previously selected as default avatar, their removal by filter_avatar_defaults() would result in the Settings -> Discussion page displaying no default avatar being selected at all.

This key is normally used for the 'Mystery Person' Gravatar, so it's unlikely to interfere with other avatar plugins. It also guarantees that if this plugin is deleted without being deactivated first, the Gravatar 'Mystery Person' is selected. Of course if a non-Gravatar avatar was previously selected, we do not change this setting. All neat and tidy ;)
